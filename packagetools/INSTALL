Before installing


If you do not need support for the XTC trajectory format, 
goMD doesn't have any requirement. If you do need XTC support, then the nsl library
is needed. The also required xdrfile library is shipped
with goMD.

Installation


Let's say you have downloaded and uncompressed the goMD package (where this file is)
to a directory and that directory is your current directory. 
I'll also assume the current directory is where you want to
install goMD. If not, move all the uncompressed files to the
installation directory.

Say you your installation directory is /home/alfred/gomd

Read and (if needed)  modify the gomd_config.sh file, in 
the installation directory.  After you have done so, go 
back to your home directory and define the required environment variables

If you are using Bash:

        cd
        echo "export GOMDROOT=/home/alfred/gomd" >> .bashrc  
        echo "source $GOMDROOT/gomd_config.sh" >> .bashrc
 
If you are using zsh, the last to lines will be:

        echo "export GOMDROOT=/home/alfred/gomd" >> .zshrc  
        echo "source $GOMDROOT/gomd_config.sh" >> .zshrc



After you, for Bash:

        source .bashrc

Or, for zsh:
        source .zshrc

goMD should be now ready to use.

The binary name is "gomd". If you do not need xtc-trajectory support,
you can use the "gomd-nox" binary.
